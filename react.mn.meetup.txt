Structure
-Break things down into the smallest pieces possible.
-By breaking things down it offers better performance and maintainability.

Performance
-When should I re-render the DOM
--When the state of the DOM changes.
--Virtual DOM matches what the user sees.
--this.setState() mutates ====> mutate this.state ====> shouldComponentUpdate()
---The above re-renders the DOM when changes on a certain node on the DOM

State
-Use state for stuff that will change within a component.
-Managed within each component you create.
-It is local
-Should never be mutated directly. Instead use built in: setState();
	--e.g. this.state.name = 'Dave'  is replaced with this.setState({name:'Dave'});
